lsh is a toy shell from Stephen Brennan's [Write a Shell in C tutorial]. I
recommend Stephen's article as a first step to understanding how a shell works
under the hood (though it is no-where "feature complete" compared to bash or
zsh). It also gave me a chance to code something in C that wasn't an Exercism
problem!
